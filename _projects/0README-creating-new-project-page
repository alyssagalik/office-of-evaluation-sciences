Steps to create a new project or update an exisiting analysis plan to add complete project materials to the website:

TO UPDATE AN EXISITING ANALYSIS PLAN PAGE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT SUMMARY:
1) In the _projects folder, click on the project page you want to update
2) Once the new project page opens, click on the pencil button to edit the project profile text.
3) Copy/paste the below four-question project summary text to replace the exisiting standard Analysis Plan registration text. 
4) Update the "Abstract" and "Summary" lines in the overview. 
      - Abstract should now show path to the Abstract file - ex. /assets/abstract/1742-reducing-energy-costs.pdf
      - Summary should now include the overview sentence (with a period)
5) Scroll down to the radio buttons at the bottom of the page, below the text entry box, and select "Create a new branch"
6) Name the branch with your project number
7) Click the green button that reads "Propose new file"

Now, upload your Abstract and complete the following final items: 
8) Being sure that you are still in the new branch you created (check this by looking in the grey box to the right of where it says 
    "office-of-evaluation-sciences" in the top left of the page; it should read "Branch: projectnumber"), navigate to /assets/abstracts/,
    and upload the pdf file of the abstract. Name it with the project number and project title. Use dashes (-) between words.
    <<DO NOT use spaces in the file name>> (abstract file name e.g., "1618-On-Base-Active-Choice-for-TSP.pdf")
9) Go to federalist.18f.gov and click "login." You will be auto-logged in through GitHub. Click on the "GitHub Branches" menu option on
    the left. Click on the "View Preview" next to the branch of your project number. 
10) Email Amira to let us know you have built the page for review

TO CREATE A NEW PROJECT
1) In the _projects folder, click "create new file" in the upper right corner
2) Once the new page opens, in the text box after "/assets/_projects/", type in:
  - the project number (all four digits), followed by a dash
  - a shorthand project title, with any words separated by dashes (not spaces)
  - ".md" to ensure the page formats correctly
  - EXAMPLE: 1619-active-choice-tsp.md
3) In the blank text box of the new page you created, copy and paste the text from line 62 through line 91 below (include the ---),
   into the new page you created in the separate tab. ((( NOTE: the text following the colons (:) below is sample text, and 
   additional notes are included following the arrows <<--. This text will need to be removed in your new page.)))
4) Per the instructions shown to the right of the arrows (<<--), update information for your project and paste in content from project
   slide where instructed (the headers are the same, so the body content will need to be inserted).
  <<NOTE: the image, image-credit, and abstract fields should remain empty for now. In order to create a single working branch 
          that can be previewed easily by agencies, create the page first, then add the abstract and image.>>
5) Remove all notes from the form (including <<-- and comments)
6) Scroll down to the radio buttons at the bottom of the page below the text entry box and select "Create a new branch"
7) Name the branch with your project number
8) CLick the green button that reads "Propose new file"

Once you have clicked that button, you've successfully created a branch that your agency will be able to preview. Now that you have
created the page and specific project branch, complete the following final items: 
9) Search on Google Images (using only "Licenses for reuse in the "Advanced" filter criteria) or Flickr.com (using only "US Government 
   work" or "No known copyrights") as the license filter in the top left corner, to choose a picture that will be the thumbnail and
   header photo. Save the image to your desktop with your project number as the file name, note the image credit (link to the
   photographer's flickr site) for later use.
10) Being sure that you are still in the new branch you created (check this by looking in the grey box to the right of where it says 
    "office-of-evaluation-sciences in the top left of the page; it should read "Branch: projectnumber"), upload the image into
     assets/img/project-images/.
   - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
11) Being sure that you are still in the new branch you created (check this by looking in the grey box to the right of where it says 
    "office-of-evaluation-sciences" in the top left of the page; it should read "Branch: projectnumber"), navigate to /assets/abstracts/,
    and upload the pdf file of the abstract. Name it with the project number and project title. Use dashes (-) between words.    
    <<DO NOT use spaces in the file name>> (abstract file name e.g., "1618-On-Base-Active-Choice-for-TSP.pdf")
    - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
12) Return to the original project page you first created. For the three fields you left blank (image, image-source, and abstract),
    replace the existing content with the information for the new image and abstract you just created.
13) Commit changes
14) Go to federalist.18f.gov and click "login." You will be auto-logged in through GitHub. Click on the "GitHub Branches" menu option
     on the left. Click on the "View Preview" next to the branch of your project number. 
15) Email Amira to let us know you have built the page for review
