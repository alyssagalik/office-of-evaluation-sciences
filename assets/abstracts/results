1514-2-iff-confirmation-prompt-update.txt:implementation of the modified interface, the  median self-reported sales amount was $445 (p <  0.05, 95% CI [87, 803]) higher for vendors signing  at the top of the form compared with those vendors  who were not required to make this confirmation.  The increase in IFF remittances in the treatment  group in just the third quarter of 2014 was $1.59  million.   Self-reported sales in subsequent quarters after  the trial was concluded (fourth quarter 2014  through third quarter 2015) were still higher for  treatment group vendors than for those in the  control group, but the difference was not  statistically significant in any quarter. Compared to  vendors in the control group, reported sales for  vendors signing at the top of the form were $357  (p=.51, 95% CI [-715, 1430]) higher in the fourth  quarter 2014, $619 (p=.31, 95% CI [-580, 1819])  higher in the first quarter 2015, $434 (p=.49, 95%  CI [-796, 1664]) higher in the second quarter 2015,  and $1,475 (p=.07, 95% CI [-135, 3085]) higher in  the third quarter 2015.    Conclusion Confirmation prompts at the  beginning of a form are a promising approach to  reducing financial self-reporting errors, especially  given the near-zero marginal cost to implement.  However, continued exposure to the confirmation  prompt does not appear to induce a persistent  reduction in errors over time. 
1602-Public-Service-Loan-Forgiveness-Pilot.txt:The error rate conditional on submitting an ECF for the treatment group (33.8 percent) was statistically indistinguishable from the control group (36.0 percent; difference=-2.23, p=0.78, 95% CI [-17.85, 13.39]).
1603-1-Income-Driven Repayment-Targeted-Messages.txt:E2, which prompted interested borrowers to submit an application with minimal discussion of benefits, had the highest IDR submission rate (8.9 percent) among IDR Applicant borrowers, but the difference was statistically insignificant compared to the baseline email (difference=0.31 p.p., p=0.70, 95% CI [-0.42, 1.03]). Among IDR Preference borrowers, the baseline email had the highest submission rate (9.0 percent), although there were no significant differences with the second email (difference=0.13 p.p., p=0.97, 95% CI [-0.61, 0.86]). Among borrowers who were in financial hardship, E4 had the highest submission rate. The increase was not statistically distinguishable from the baseline emails for those in forbearance, who had a 5.6 percent application rate (difference=0.36 p.p., p=0.39, 95% CI [-0.22, 0.94]), but was significantly higher than the baseline email among borrowers in deferment, increasing submissions by 0.96 percentage points from a base rate of 6.8 percent (p<0.01, 95% CI [0.29, 1.63]). Among delinquent borrowers, E5 was the only email to significantly increase IDR submission rates compared to the no-email control group’s rate of 3.45 percent (difference=0.52 p.p., p= 0.03, 95% CI [0.03, 1.01]). Among FFEL borrowers, neither E6 nor E7 significantly changed applications submission rates compared to the control group. The email presenting the benefits of REPAYE first (E6) increased applications from 6.1 percent to 6.6 percent (p=0.14, 95% CI [-.11, 1.03]), while E7 increased applications to 6.5 percent (p=0.25, 95% CI [-0.18, .96]). Conclusions. Borrowers who had previously shown interest in IDR were more likely to submit an IDR application if sent an email prompting application. Borrowers who had taken action to claim a forbearance or deferment of their loan payment due to economic hardship were more likely to submit an IDR application after receiving a targeted email using loss aversion along with a specific example of how they can pay $0 per month. Borrowers who were in delinquency and had not taken any action were more likely to submit an IDR application after receiving a targeted email containing a prompted choice. FFEL borrowers were not likely to respond to an email campaign encouraging them to proactively choose a new repayment plan.
1604-Income-Driven Repayment-Recertification.txt:Agency Objective. Increase the number of student loan borrowers completing annual Income-Drive Repayment (IDR) recertification. Results. In Cohort 1, the message including the borrower’s actual monthly payment increase resulted in a higher recertification rate (33.9 percent) than the average monthly payment increase (difference=2.64 p.p., p < 0.01, 95% CI [2.15, 3.13]). In Cohort 2, recertification rates were indistinguishable between the group sent evenly spaced reminders (64.1 percent) and those sent reminders on consecutive days (64.3 percent; difference=0.19 p.p., p=0.53, 95% CI [0.40, 0.77]). In Cohort 3, including Cindy Battle’s signature had no effect on recertification rates. Recertification dates for those sent emails with the recertification date recertified at a marginally higher rate (64.6 percent) than those not sent the date in the email (63.8 percent; difference=0.84 p.p., p=0.06, 95% CI [-0.03, 1.71]).
1607-Increasing-Patient-Use-of-Health-IT.txt:Agency Objective. Increase patients’ access to online patient portals and health information technology. Office operations made random assignment by patients or providers infeasible, so the new AVS was tested using a difference-in-differences estimation approach. The difference in activation rate for system primary care patients before and after August 25, 2015 was compared to the difference in activation rate of two separate patient groups during the same time periods: 1) non-primary care providers of the local health care network, and 2) primary care providers of a different health care system that uses the same online patient portal system as our partner health care system. Results. A difference-in-differences estimate suggests that the revised AVS instructions lead to a 9.98 percentage increase in the probability of online patient portal account activation 58 (p=0.07, 95% CI = [-0.69, 20.66]). Conclusions. There are promising signs that clear actions steps may encourage patients to access the online patient portal component of their health care system’s EHR. However the study can be improved with better ability to identify the study population and having more comparable treatment and comparison sites.
1609-Federal-Health-Insurance-Marketplace-Enrollment-Emails.txt:In the goal progress trial, there were no significant effects on open or click rates of varying individuals’ perception of progress towards picking a plan. Consistent with the findings on deadline framing, we do not observe meaningful differences in enrollment: enrollment was 0.16 percent in the “middle step” group, compared to 0.14 percent in the “last step” group (difference < 0.01 p.p., p=0.51, 95% CI [0.03, 0.07]). In the first personal motivations trial, individuals who received the personal motivation email had lower open and click rates than individuals who received the generic control email. Open rates were 13.84 and 14.67 percent, respectively (difference = 0.83 p.p., p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.72, 0.94]). Click-through rates were 1.61 and 2.14 percent, respectively (difference = 0.53 p.p., p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.48, 0.57,]). Differences in enrollment rates could not be precisely estimated, with 0.03 percent enrollment in each group (difference < 0.01 p.p., p = 0.17, 95% CI [0.00, 0.01]). In the second personal motivations trial, individuals who received the personal motivation

1612-2-nslp-rolling-verification.txt:requests are compared to the rates for  business-as-usual verification requests in Broward  County, Los Angeles USD, San Diego USD and  Prince George’s County, controlling for the date  that applications were submitted and the initial  eligibility determination for each applicant (either  free or reduced-price meals).   Overall response rates increased by an average of  2.5 percentage points (p=0.11, 95% CI [-0.01, 0.06]) 
1612-2-nslp-rolling-verification.txt:for applicants selected using rolling verification.  When analyzing each district separately, response  rates increased for applicants receiving verification  soon after applying in three districts (Broward, San  Diego, and Prince George’s) but decreased in Los  Angeles.   Rolling verification response rates were 7.4  percentage points higher in Broward County  (p=0.03 , 95% CI [0.01, 0.14]),  2.7 percentage  points higher in San Diego USD (p=0.72 , 95% CI  [-0.12, 0.17]), and 4.4 percentage points higher in  Prince George’s County (p=0.27, 95% CI [-0.03,  0.12]). Response rates in Los Angeles USD were 3.9  percentage points lower among rolling verification  recipients (p=0.06, 95% CI [-0.08, 0.0]). Effects of  rolling verification could not be evaluated in  Orange County because all applicants received  requests shortly after submitting their applications.    
1615-Financial-Aid-for-HUD-Assisted-Youth.txt:from the behavioral literature. The personal story from First Lady Michelle Obama was intended to motivate educational aspiration and reduce the anxiety low-income students may 36 feel when thinking about college, and the postcard presented information without 37 requiring the recipient to open an envelope. Approximately 5,000 individuals were sent each of the nine variations; the control group includes approximately 160,000 individuals (n = 203,191). Results. All youth and full time students 17 to 20 as of January 2016 were included in the trial, and random assignment was performed without knowing which individuals already submitted a FAFSA for the 2016–2017 academic year. The mailings were sent on March 24, 2016 so we only consider individuals who had not submitted a FAFSA by the mailing date in the results 38 below. There are no significant effects of sending mailings on the rate of FAFSA completions. Twenty-two percent of individuals who were sent some kind of mailing completed the FAFSA, which was 0.30 percentage point higher than the rate of the control group (p=0.24, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.80]). The most effective sender was the First Lady using her personal story, with a 22.4 percent FAFSA completion rate, 0.65 percentage point higher than the control group (p=0.11, 95% CI [-0.16,
1615-Financial-Aid-for-HUD-Assisted-Youth.txt:1.46]). The letter including the paper FAFSA was the most effective format, also with a 22.4 percent completion rate (0.69, p=0.10, 95% CI [0.12, 1.50]). Conclusions. The effects of the mailings were not large enough to say with confidence that they increased FAFSA completion rates but there is suggestive evidence that some messengers and formats were more effective than others. The most effective messenger appeared to be the First Lady using her personal story, but the least effective was the First Lady using FSA’s language. This could suggest that the messenger was more effective when the message seems authentic. The most effective format was including the paper FAFSA. From a behavioral perspective, this format likely was effective because it made it easier for recipients to follow through on intentions that they already held.
1615-Financial-Aid-for-HUD-Assisted-Youth.txt:Notes: Each row reports the estimated difference between the FAFSA completion rate for the indicated group and that of the control group in percentage points, the associated p=value and 95% confidence interval. The control group FAFSA completion rate was 21.7 percent.
1616-Process-Improvements-for-Virtual-PEER-Forums.txt:Agency Objective. Increase the awareness and utilization of Virtual PEER Forums and online resources for military caregivers using an email that directs mailing-list subscribers to an interactive web-based activity. Background. Virtual PEER (Personalized Experiences, Education, and Resources) Forums provide an opportunity for those caring for ill and wounded service members to meet remotely with their peers in real time to provide and receive input in the form of knowledge and resource sharing, as well as socioemotional support. The Offices of Military Community and Family Policy and Warrior Care Policy sought to increase awareness and utilization of Virtual PEER Forums by those who are eligible to participate, along with increasing general awareness of the online resources available to this population. Methods. The Department of Defense (DoD) Office of Warrior Care Policy (WCP) worked with OES to explore improvements to existing communication about monthly Virtual PEER Forums for military caregivers. The team designed an activity for engaging blog subscribers in the PEER Forums. In collaboration with WCP, OES designed two primary changes to the existing outreach strategy. First, the team used language (in both the subject line and email body) that emphasized caregivers receiving support from their peers versus giving support to their peers. All individuals who self-subscribed to an email mailing list maintained by WCP received one of two versions of the email, emphasizing either receiving or giving support. In addition, OES designed an interactive webbased activity to encourage individuals to more actively engage after clicking on a link in the email. This link directed individuals to a short (2 minute) web activity where they were able to self-assess their knowledge of the resources 55 provided by WCP. Results. The test was conducted in July 2016. Among the group receiving emails emphasizing the receipt of support, 5,927 emails were delivered, leading to a 16.4 percent unique open rate and a 2.4 percent click-through rate to the web-based activity. Among the group receiving emails emphasizing giving support, 5,926 emails were delivered with a 15.3 percent unique open rate and a 1.9 percent click-through rate, a difference of 1.1 percent (p=0.1, 95% CI = [-0.20, 2.43]), and 0.5 percent (p=0.05, 95% CI = [0.00, 56 1.04]) respectively. Forty-seven percent of individuals who began the web-based activity completed it, and five new caregivers signed up for the July forum— three from the group who received emails emphasizing giving support and two from the group who received emails emphasizing receiving support. In addition, during the three-day period directly after the emails were sent, WCP reports that the daily views to the Caregiver Resource webpage increased by 70 percent relative to the average daily views in 2016 to date. Conclusions. The test comparing receiving and giving language suggested that highlighting the benefits to subscribers increased email open rates, though not click-through rates.
1702-Project-MGMT.txt:intervention from manager.    Results  The  Growth  Mindset  tools  did  not  have  any  detectable  effect  on  employee  or  self-assessments,  although  the  effects  are  imprecisely  measured  due  to  employee  and  manager  response  rates.  For  example,  the  change  in  average  employee  assessment  among  the  managers  in  the  Growth Mindset  group was  about  .17  smaller  than  the  corresponding  change  in  the  managers  in  the  control  group  [p=.3,  95%  CI  -.49,  .15].  This  difference  (shown  in  the  third  boxplot on  the  right  of  Figure  1),  is  mostly  driven  by  the  fact  that,  by  change,  the  baseline  scores  of  the  managers  in  the  treatment  group  were  a  bit higher  than  the  managers  randomly  assigned  to  the  control group. 
1706-Students-at-Risk-to-Withdraw.txt:Additional analyses suggest that the decrease in  enrollment was concentrated among public  (decrease of 1.33 ppt, p<0.01) and private,  not-for-profit institutions (decrease of 1.56 ppt,  p=0.05). There were no significant differences in  enrollment when looking at for-profit institutions  alone. The results also suggest an interaction with  family income, with larger decreases in enrollment  among those with lower incomes.    Conclusion Emails reminding borrowers of  financial aid and loan repayment decisions  decreased enrollment in the second and third  program years. Given that the borrowers included  in the study were at risk to withdraw, it is possible  some made the decision not to return to school  earlier than they otherwise would have.  
1727-va-health-care-benefits.txt:significant increase in enrollment within 30 days  post-separation among service members assigned  to receive email outreach. Enrollment in VA health  benefits was 10.7% in the control group and 10.9%  in the pooled treatment arms. The difference  between the two enrollment rates is not  statistically significant (p=0.74, 95% CI [-.009,  .012]). We can rule out an increase in enrollment as  small as 1.2 percentage points due to the email  campaign.3  For combat veterans, we observe that 
1727-va-health-care-benefits.txt:enrollment within 30 days is 11.9% in the control  arm and 12.4% in the pooled treatment arm; again,  the difference is not statistically significant (p=.45,  95% CI [-.008, .017]). 
1727-va-health-care-benefits.txt:statistically significant (p=.000, 95% CI [-.031,-.009]),  suggesting lower open rates in the formal arm.  4  As previously noted, a large number of TSMs were  excluded because their email addresses were not  available. In addition, estimates from other Concierge for  Care projects suggest that up to one-third of individuals  identified as TSMs by the Department of Defense did not  separate from the military during the pilot period. 
1733-project-abstract.txt:targeted communications around FSA enrollment  did not lead to increased enrollment. Enrollment in  FSAs was 27.4% in the control group and 27.2% in  the pooled treatment arms. The difference  between the two enrollment rates is not  statistically significant (p=.838, 95% CI [-.021,  .017]).  The average amount contributed over the  2018 calendar year is $686.49 in the control group  and $683.66 in the pooled treatment arms, and  Unless noted otherwise, all of the analysis reported in this  abstract was prespecified in an analysis plan, which can be found  at https://oes.gsa.gov.
1733-project-abstract.txt:again the difference is insignificant (p=.929, 95% CI  [-65.053, 59.395]). We can rule out an increase in  the probability of enrollment as small as 1.7  percentage points due to the email treatments. In  addition, no significant differences are evident  comparing across the treatment arms. Figure 1  shows the probability of contributing to a FSA by  experimental arm, in conjunction with the 95%  confidence interval; Figure 2 similarly shows mean  contributions by experimental arm. 
1735-flu-shot-abstract.txt:targeted communication around the importance of  accessing the flu vaccine did not lead to increased  uptake of the vaccine. In the full experimental  sample, uptake of the flu vaccine was 40% in the  control group and 38% in the treatment arm. The  difference between the two enrollment rates is  statistically insignificant (p=.475, 95% CI [-.056,  .026]). In addition, due to incomplete baseline  information around prior uptake of the flu vaccine,  some patients included in the experiment had  received the vaccine prior to the launch of the  intervention. When we restrict the sample to  exclude these early adopters, uptake of the flu  vaccine during the post-intervention period was  18% in the control group and 17% in the treatment  arm, and the difference between the two  enrollment rates is statistically insignificant  (p=.923, 95% CI [-.035, .039]). Figures 1 and 2 show  the probability of flu vaccine uptake for patients in  the control and treatment arms for the full sample  and the restricted sample, respectively. 
1739-gsa-auctions.txt:Results The figure shows that the treatment  group maximum bid amount was about  $7,670,000 more in total than the control  group during this period (in which the  experiment sent approximately 800,000  emails to approximately 37,000 users across  7120 lots).2 Within lot, the treatment group  paid more, on average than the control group  98% of the time. OES estimated the effect of  the emails on participation in the targeted  auction (i.e. bidding more than zero) to be .08  percentage points (approximately .05 % of the  control group bid and about .13 % of the  treatment group bid) ( 95% CI [.06,.09], p <  .001). The effect of the program on maximum  bid amount was about $20 on average but this  difference was not precisely estimated given  the huge number of zeros and the few  extremely large bids: the maximum bids  ranged from $0 to $2.6 million, 50% of the  non-zero bids were between about $10 and  $500 with only 10% more than $11,000) (95%  CI [-17,67], p=.3). Although this research  design had little information available for  statistical tests of the average or even total  differences,  we can deﬁnitely reject the null  hypothesis that the treatment group bid the  same amount as the control group if we  compare the rank of the treatment group bids 
1742-reducing-energy-costs.txt:expected receipt of the flyers. The sample includes  2,514 units with 11 or more days of energy use  data during the outcome period.5 Average daily  energy use recorded by WEMs during the outcome  period was compared for units sent no flyer to units  sent a flyer with a single or multiple energy-saving  tips. All comparisons controlled for mean baseline  energy use during a two-week period in late August  and early September 2017 and assignment block  fixed effects (42 development--bedroom  combinations).      that follow are reported both  without adjusting for multiple  comparisons and adjusting for  multiple comparisons using the  Holm-Bonferroni family-wise error rate. Units sent  flyers with either a single tip or multiple tips used  less energy per day during the two weeks following  expected receipt of the flyers compared to units  not sent flyers, although the difference was not  statistically significant. On average, energy use for  the control group was 16.88 kWh per day; those  sent the single-tip flyer used 16.56 kWh per day,  and those sent the multiple-tip flyer used 16.72  kWh per day. Energy use among units sent any flyer  (single- or multiple-tips) was 0.235 kWh per day  lower than units in the control group, but this  difference was not statistically significant (p=0.14  (Holm-Bonferroni-corrected p=0.42) , 95% CI  [-0.55, 0.08]). Differences between the single-tip  flyer and control (-0.317 kWh per day, p=0.08  (Holm-Bonferroni-corrected p=0.35), 95% CI  [-0.68, 0.05]), multiple-tip flyer and control (-0.155  kWh per day, p=0.40 (Holm-Bonferroni-corrected  p=0.77), 95% CI [-0.52, 0.21]), and between  single-tip flyer and multiple-tip flyer (-.162 kWh 
1742-reducing-energy-costs.txt:per day, p=0.39 (Holm-Bonferroni-corrected  p=0.77), 95% CI [-0.53,0.20]) also were not  statistically significant. Figure 1 shows the point  estimate and confidence interval for each effect.
